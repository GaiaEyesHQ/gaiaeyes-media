# GaiaEyes Media Repository Reference Guide

This guide explains how media assets and supporting datasets are organized in this
repository. Use it as the primary reference when adding, updating, or removing
files so that downstream automation can continue to locate the assets it needs.

## Directory overview

| Path | Purpose | Key conventions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `backgrounds/` | Curated static photography and illustrations used as layout backgrounds. | Categorized by aspect ratio (`square/`, `tall/`, `wide/`). File names describe the subject (e.g., `aurora_square_1.jpg`). Avoid spaces and prefer lowercase with underscores. |
| `data/` | Machine-readable feeds used by dashboards and automated posts. | JSON and CSV exports, plus derived images (e.g., `magnetosphere_sparkline.png`). Timestamped files use the ISO-8601-like pattern `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`. Always keep `*_latest.*` copies synchronized with the most recent ingest. |
| `fonts/` | Font families embedded in creative assets. | Store complete font families in sub-folders when multiple weights are required (`Poppins/`). Include license files such as `OFL.txt` when provided by the type foundry. |
| `images/` | Rendered creative assets consumed by GaiaEyes social and product surfaces. | Top-level files are manually curated hero images (`daily_affects.jpg`, `tomsk_latest.png`, etc.). The `space/` subdirectory is populated automatically; do not rename or prune timestamped imagery without coordinating with the ingestion pipeline. |
| `public/` | Assets synced to public web properties. | Currently houses `hazards/latest.json`, the most recent hazard feed. Mirror the structure expected by downstream clients before publishing new files. |

## Working with background imagery

* **Source quality:** Favor 4k+ resolution masters to preserve flexibility across
  square, tall, and wide crops. If you must downscale, keep the shortest side at
  least 2048 px.
* **Color grading:** Apply non-destructive adjustments so alternate crops can be
  regenerated from the same source file.
* **New additions:** Place images in the folder that matches their final aspect
  ratio. If a single asset needs multiple crops, save each crop separately and
  append a suffix (`_square`, `_tall`, `_wide`).

## Data feed hygiene

* **Timestamped snapshots:** Files such as `magnetosphere_20251013T043502.691186Z.json`
  are immutable historical captures. Never overwrite or delete them unless there
  is a legal or privacy requirement.
* **Latest pointers:** Each dataset that powers live surfaces has a `*_latest.*`
  companion. Overwrite the pointer when publishing new data so automation always
  reads the newest snapshot without having to enumerate the full history.
* **Format validation:** Run JSON validation (`jq empty <file.json>`) or CSV linting
  before committing updated feeds to avoid breaking importers.

## Fonts and licensing

* Maintain a single source of truth for each typeface. If you update a font
  file, update every weight/variant at the same time.
* Always include or update the license (`OFL.txt`, `LICENSE.txt`, etc.) when a
  font package changes.
* Keep filenames intact to match references in design tools and code exports.

## Images and generated overlays

* The `images/` folder blends hand-designed assets (`daily_stats.jpg`) with
  generated overlays (`tomsk_params_*_overlay_latest.png`). Hand-designed assets
  should have descriptive filenames; overlays should keep the autogenerated
  naming pattern so the data pipeline can refresh them in place.
* The `images/space/` directory contains high-frequency telemetry captures.
  These filenames encode the instrument or feed (`a_station`, `geospace_1d`,
  `ovation_nh`, etc.) followed by the timestamp. Avoid manual edits in this
  directory—coordinate changes with the ingest job instead.

## Public export considerations

* Assets under `public/` are scraped by external systems. Audit the expected JSON
  schema or file layout before publishing changes.
* If you need to publish a new public feed, create a subdirectory under
  `public/` that mirrors the production URL path so deployments remain
  consistent.

## Contributor checklist

Before opening a pull request:

1. Verify new assets follow the naming patterns above and omit spaces in
   filenames.
2. Ensure "latest" pointers are updated when new snapshot data is added.
3. Run format validation on structured data (JSON/CSV) and optimize imagery when
   possible (e.g., `pngquant`, `cwebp`).
4. Document any automation dependencies or external data sources in the PR
   description so reviewers understand the update cadence.

Following these guidelines keeps the GaiaEyes media library reliable for both
human designers and automated systems.
