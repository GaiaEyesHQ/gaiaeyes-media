{"day":"2025-11-14","title":"unsettled cosmic energies","caption":"Today’s space conditions reflect an unsettled tone, with a mix of fresh solar flare effects and lively Schumann resonance. While the geomagnetic activity is generally quiet, the high solar wind can create some fluctuations in focus and energy levels. It’s a good idea to schedule breaks and allow for flexibility in your tasks, as variability is likely throughout the day. Stay mindful of your body's signals and adapt accordingly.\n\n— Kp 2.0  •  Bz -0.3 nT  •  Schumann 7.57 Hz","snapshot":"Currently, the solar wind is elevated, contributing to a lively atmosphere in terms of electromagnetic activity. The magnetic field shows slight southward orientation, which can influence how we feel physically and emotionally. Though there are no significant coronal mass ejections to worry about, recent solar flares may have lingering effects on our systems. Keep an eye out for potential auroras over the next few days as conditions align for visibility.","affects":"You might experience variable focus and energy today, so be sure to give yourself extra time around critical tasks. Some may notice a dip in heart rate variability due to the magnetic influences, making paced breathing techniques beneficial. Sleep quality could be affected; prioritize dimming lights earlier to support restfulness. Minor disruptions in communications or navigation systems may occur at higher latitudes due to these conditions.","playbook":"Consider taking 5 to 10 minutes for paced breathing exercises or short HRV biofeedback sessions to manage any stress. Stay hydrated and replenish electrolytes while also getting some gentle mobility or brief outdoor exposure for grounding. Protect your sleep by using blue-light filters in the evening and establishing a consistent wind-down routine.","metrics":{"kp_max_24h":2.0,"solar_wind_kms":607.9921319796954,"flares_24h":2.0,"cmes_24h":0,"schumann_value_hz":7.57,"harmonics":{"f1":7.57,"f2":15.21,"h3":null,"h4":null},"space_json":{"kp_now":null,"bz_now":null,"sw_now":null,"aurora_headline":"G2 possible","aurora_window":"Next 72h"},"earthscope_json":{"title":null,"caption":null,"affects":null,"playbook":null,"metrics":{},"quakes":{"total":10,"total_24h":3,"top":{"mag":5.2,"place":"156 km E of Severo-Kuril’sk, Russia","time_utc":"2025-11-14T11:33:45.194000Z","url":"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us6000rn8e","tsunami":0}},"quakes_count":3},"tone":"unsettled","bands":{"kp":"quiet","sw":"high","bz":"slightly southward"},"sections":{"caption":"Today’s space conditions reflect an unsettled tone, with a mix of fresh solar flare effects and lively Schumann resonance.
