The solar wind is elevated, and the magnetic field is southward, which could lead to fluctuations in focus and energy levels.

Some individuals might notice shifts in heart rate variability due to the southward magnetic field—consider paced breathing to maintain balance. Sleep patterns could be disrupted, so a gentle wind-down routine is essential for restful nights. If you're sensitive, you may feel brief tingles or heaviness; taking micro-breaks can be beneficial.","playbook":"To support yourself today, try 5–10 minutes of paced breathing or brief HRV biofeedback exercises. Stay hydrated and consider light mobility practices to keep energy flowing. Protect your sleep by using blue-light filters on screens and adhering to a consistent bedtime routine. For those feeling sensitive, a quick outdoor walk or warm pack may provide relief during nerve flare moments.","metrics":{"kp_max_24h":4.67,"solar_wind_kms":516.8016861219196,"flares_24h":0,"cmes_24h":0,"schumann_value_hz":7.8,"harmonics":{"f1":7.8,"f2":15.4,"h3":null,"h4":null},"space_json":{"kp_now":null,"bz_now":null,"sw_now":null,"aurora_headline":"G1 possible","aurora_window":"Next 72h"},"earthscope_json":{"title":null,"caption":null,"affects":null,"playbook":null,"metrics":{},"quakes":{"total":10,"total_24h":4,"top":{"mag":5.4,"place":"82 km W of Ollagüe, Chile","time_utc":"2025-12-13T12:18:46.390000Z","url":"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us6000run8","tsunami":0}},"quakes_count":4},"tone":"unsettled","bands":{"kp":"active","sw":"elevated","bz":"southward"},"sections":{"caption":"Today brings an active geomagnetic environment, creating a sense of variability in daily rhythms.
