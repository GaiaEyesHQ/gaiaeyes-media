{"day":"2026-01-26","title":"shifting cosmic currents","caption":"Today’s space weather is marked by unsettled conditions, with solar wind flowing steadily and magnetic fields shifting southward. This variability can impact focus and energy levels, so it’s wise to allow extra time for tasks and breaks. A minor chance for auroras exists in the coming days, adding a touch of wonder to the sky if conditions align.

There has been recent activity from coronal mass ejections, contributing to the unsettled tone. The Schumann resonance is lively today, which may influence emotional and physical states as well.","affects":"You might notice your focus ebbing and flowing throughout the day; be prepared to adjust your plans accordingly. The southward magnetic influence could lead to a drop in heart rate variability for some, so practicing paced breathing may be beneficial. Sleep quality might be impacted if you don’t wind down properly; maintaining warm lighting in the evening can help. Communication devices and GPS may experience minor inaccuracies at higher latitudes due to these conditions.","playbook":"To navigate today's dynamics, consider engaging in short sessions of paced breathing or biofeedback for around 5–10 minutes. Stay hydrated and get some gentle movement or daylight exposure when possible. Protect your sleep by using blue-light filters and establishing a consistent evening routine. If you feel sensitive, stepping outside for a brief walk can help reset your system.","metrics":{"kp_max_24h":3.0,"solar_wind_kms":497.3884995507637,"flares_24h":0,"cmes_24h":1.0,"schumann_value_hz":7.67,"harmonics":{"f1":7.67,"f2":15.0,"h3":null,"h4":null},"space_json":{"kp_now":null,"bz_now":null,"sw_now":null,"aurora_headline":"G1 possible today","aurora_window":"Next 72h"},"earthscope_json":{"title":null,"caption":null,"affects":null,"playbook":null,"metrics":{},"quakes":{"total":10,"total_24h":10,"top":{"mag":5.6,"place":"37 km SSW of Mendi, Papua New Guinea","time_utc":"2026-01-26T17:06:23.561000Z","url":"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us6000s4jy","tsunami":0}},"quakes_count":10},"tone":"unsettled","bands":{"kp":"unsettled","sw":"normal","bz":"southward"},"sections":{"caption":"Today’s space weather is marked by unsettled conditions, with solar wind flowing steadily and magnetic fields shifting southward.
