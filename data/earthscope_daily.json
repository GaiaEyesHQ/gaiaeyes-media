The solar wind is elevated, and the magnetic field is oriented southward, which can lead to fluctuations in focus and well-being.

This can also impact heart rate variability; if you feel stress or discomfort, try paced breathing techniques to help manage it.

Minor disruptions in communication technologies might occur, especially at higher latitudes.","playbook":"Engage in 5–10 minutes of paced breathing or brief biofeedback exercises to stabilize your nervous system. Stay hydrated and consider light exposure during the day along with gentle movement to keep your body balanced. Protect your sleep by using blue-light filters in the evening and establishing a consistent wind-down routine. If you feel sensitive today, take a quick outdoor walk or use a warm pack for any nerve flare-ups.","metrics":{"kp_max_24h":5.0,"solar_wind_kms":587.8867268041237,"flares_24h":0,"cmes_24h":0,"schumann_value_hz":7.96,"harmonics":{"f1":7.96,"f2":15.82,"h3":null,"h4":null},"space_json":{"kp_now":null,"bz_now":null,"sw_now":null,"aurora_headline":"G1 possible","aurora_window":"Next 72h"},"earthscope_json":{"title":null,"caption":null,"affects":null,"playbook":null,"metrics":{},"quakes":{"total":8,"total_24h":3,"top":{"mag":5.4,"place":"8 km S of Pondaguitan, Philippines","time_utc":"2025-11-25T10:45:18.837000Z","url":"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000rdmx","tsunami":0}},"quakes_count":3},"tone":"stormy","bands":{"kp":"storm","sw":"elevated","bz":"southward"},"sections":{"caption":"Today, we are experiencing a geomagnetic storm that prompts heightened sensitivity and shifting energy patterns.
