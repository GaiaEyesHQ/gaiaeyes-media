The solar wind is flowing steadily, and the magnetic field is oriented southward, which can stir up some restlessness. While you might feel a bit more wired than usual, it's essential to maintain your rhythm rather than push too hard. If you're sensitive to these shifts, consider creating buffer zones in your schedule.\n\n— Kp 4.3  •  Bz -9.8 nT  •  Schumann 7.27 Hz","snapshot":"In this space weather snapshot, we observe active geomagnetics alongside recent coronal mass ejections. The Schumann resonance is lively, indicating fluctuations that may impact our connection to Earth’s electromagnetic field. With no significant solar flares reported, the focus remains on the geomagnetic influences.","affects":"You may notice a change in focus and energy, leaning towards a textured experience rather than a steady flow. Some individuals may find their heart rate variability affected by the southward magnetic field, leading to a need for paced breathing techniques. Sleep routines should be protected—consider softer screens as you wind down. Those particularly sensitive might feel the need to consciously relax their bodies during this time.","playbook":"To navigate today effectively, try 5–10 minutes of paced breathing to help regulate your response. Stay hydrated and ensure you're getting some sunlight; gentle mobility can also help ease tension. Protect your sleep by using blue-light filters and maintaining a consistent bedtime routine. If you feel heightened sensitivity, a quick walk outdoors or using a warm pack can provide comfort.","metrics":{"kp_max_24h":4.33,"solar_wind_kms":429.4421568627451,"flares_24h":0,"cmes_24h":2.0,"schumann_value_hz":7.27,"harmonics":{"f1":7.27,"f2":14.59,"h3":null,"h4":null},"space_json":{"kp_now":null,"bz_now":null,"sw_now":null,"aurora_headline":"G1 possible","aurora_window":"Next 72h"},"earthscope_json":{"title":null,"caption":null,"affects":null,"playbook":null,"metrics":{},"quakes":{"total":10,"total_24h":2,"top":{"mag":5.2,"place":"100 km NNW of Finschhafen, Papua New Guinea","time_utc":"2026-01-05T00:42:03.817000Z","url":"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000rmhl","tsunami":0}},"quakes_count":2},"tone":"unsettled","bands":{"kp":"active","sw":"normal","bz":"southward"},"sections":{"caption":"Today brings an active space weather environment with notable geomagnetic activity.
