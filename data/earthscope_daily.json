Expect moments of pulse and dip; it's a day to schedule breaks and buffer your critical tasks. With strong southward magnetic fields, some may feel a decrease in heart rate variability, so pacing is key. Overall, while unsettled conditions can challenge your rhythm, they also invite you to adapt and flow with the changes.\n\n— Kp 4.3  •  Bz -11.6 nT  •  Schumann 7.51 Hz","snapshot":"The space weather is currently lively with active geomagnetics and a notable Schumann resonance. Solar wind flows normally while magnetic fields are strongly oriented southward. There have been no significant solar flares or coronal mass ejections in the last day. Aurora chances look promising over the next few days, so keep an eye out for potential displays in the night sky.","affects":"You might experience fluctuating focus and energy levels today, with brief bursts followed by gentle lulls. The southward magnetic fields can lead to lower heart rate variability for some, making paced breathing helpful. Ensure a calming bedtime routine to support sleep quality tonight. If you're prone to discomfort on stormy days, have heat or contrast therapy ready for flare-ups.","playbook":"Engage in 5–10 minutes of paced breathing or quick heart rate variability biofeedback to help stabilize your system.
