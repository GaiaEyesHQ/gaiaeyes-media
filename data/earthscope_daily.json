{"day":"2026-01-26","title":"unsettled cosmic energies","caption":"Today's space weather brings a tone of unsettled energy as solar wind flows steadily and magnetic fields shift. With some recent coronal mass ejections, expect a mix of surges and dips in your daily rhythm. There are chances for auroras later, so keep an eye on the skies if you're in the right area. Overall, it's a day to buffer your schedule and allow for flexibility as you navigate these fluctuations.\n\n— Kp 3.0  •  Bz -6.5 nT  •  Schumann 7.68 Hz","snapshot":"The space weather landscape shows moderate activity with steady solar wind and southward magnetic influences. Recent coronal mass ejections add to the dynamic conditions, while the Schumann resonance is lively, indicating some energetic shifts. Expect a bit of variability throughout your day; this might feel like a push-pull effect on focus and energy levels.","affects":"You may experience brief pulses and dips in focus or energy today, suggesting a need for short blocks of work followed by gentle pacing. Those sensitive to such fluctuations might notice changes in heart rate variability, so practicing paced breathing can be beneficial. Sleep could be affected, so dimming lights earlier will help maintain continuity. For those particularly attuned to these energies, micro-breaks may assist in managing feelings of heaviness or tingles.","playbook":"Incorporate 5–10 minutes of paced breathing or HRV biofeedback into your routine today. Stay hydrated with electrolytes and aim for gentle mobility throughout the day. Protect your sleep by using blue-light filters in the evening and establishing a consistent wind-down period before bed. If you feel particularly sensitive, consider grounding yourself with a quick walk outdoors or using a warm pack to soothe any nerve flare sensations.","metrics":{"kp_max_24h":3.0,"solar_wind_kms":496.8605851979346,"flares_24h":0,"cmes_24h":2.0,"schumann_value_hz":7.68,"harmonics":{"f1":7.68,"f2":15.02,"h3":null,"h4":null},"space_json":{"kp_now":null,"bz_now":null,"sw_now":null,"aurora_headline":"G1 possible today","aurora_window":"Next 72h"},"earthscope_json":{"title":null,"caption":null,"affects":null,"playbook":null,"metrics":{},"quakes":{"total":10,"total_24h":10,"top":{"mag":5.6,"place":"37 km SSW of Mendi, Papua New Guinea","time_utc":"2026-01-26T17:06:23.561000Z","url":"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us6000s4jy","tsunami":0}},"quakes_count":10},"tone":"unsettled","bands":{"kp":"unsettled","sw":"normal","bz":"southward"},"sections":{"caption":"Today's space weather brings a tone of unsettled energy as solar wind flows steadily and magnetic fields shift.
