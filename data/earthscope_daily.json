{"day":"2025-10-10","title":"Lively Yet Unsettled","caption":"Today’s cosmic environment is lively yet unsettled, with fluctuations that may impact your focus and energy. Expect a mix of highs and lows, prompting you to schedule breaks and buffer your critical tasks. The southward magnetic field is a reminder to pace yourself throughout the day, especially if you're sensitive to shifts in energy.\n\n— Kp 3.7  •  Bz -6.1 nT  •  Schumann 6.81 Hz","snapshot":"In this space weather snapshot, we see an unsettled atmosphere characterized by notable variability. The solar wind flows steadily, while the magnetic field is directed southward. There are no solar flares or coronal mass ejections reported, indicating a quieter solar surface. Schumann resonance remains vibrant, which could influence your well-being.","affects":"You might feel pulses and dips in focus today, so gentle pacing will be beneficial. If you're sensitive to energy fluctuations, your heart rate variability may be affected; consider practicing paced breathing to help stabilize it. Maintain your bedtime routine to protect sleep quality, and be aware that communication systems may experience minor accuracy issues at higher latitudes.","playbook":"To navigate today's conditions, try 5–10 minutes of paced breathing or brief HRV biofeedback sessions. Stay hydrated and include electrolytes in your diet; gentle mobility and short exposure to daylight can also help. Protect your sleep with blue-light filters and a consistent wind-down routine before bed.","metrics":{"kp_max_24h":3.67,"solar_wind_kms":349.728029375765,"flares_24h":0,"cmes_24h":0,"schumann_value_hz":6.81,"harmonics":{"f1":6.81,"f2":15.47,"h3":null,"h4":null},"space_json":{"kp_now":null,"bz_now":null,"sw_now":null,"aurora_headline":"G1 possible","aurora_window":"Next 72h"},"earthscope_json":{"title":null,"caption":null,"affects":null,"playbook":null,"metrics":{},"quakes":{"total":10,"total_24h":10,"top":{"mag":5,"place":"67 km E of Baculin, Philippines","time_utc":"2025-10-10T13:13:32.485000Z","url":"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us6000rg4s","tsunami":0}},"quakes_count":10},"tone":"unsettled","bands":{"kp":"unsettled","sw":"normal","bz":"southward"},"sections":{"caption":"Today’s cosmic environment is lively yet unsettled, with fluctuations that may impact your focus and energy.
