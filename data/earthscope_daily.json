{"day":"2025-11-16","title":"unsettled cosmic currents","caption":"Today’s space weather presents a lively yet unsettled tone, with variable influences that may affect your daily rhythm. The solar wind is elevated, and the magnetic field is oriented southward, which can create fluctuations in focus and energy. It’s a day to build in breaks and prepare for unexpected shifts in your tasks. Aurora sightings are possible over the next few days, so keep an eye on the skies if you’re in the right areas.\n\n— Kp 3.7  •  Bz -7.6 nT  •  Schumann 7.15 Hz","snapshot":"We are experiencing unsettled space weather characterized by a lively Schumann resonance. The solar wind is moving swiftly, while the magnetic field is southward, leading to some variability. There have been no recent solar flares or coronal mass ejections, which keeps activity levels stable. Minor accuracy issues in communications may be noticed at higher latitudes, and one notable earthquake has been recorded recently.","affects":"You might feel a variable flow of focus and energy today, so it’s wise to add margins around your critical tasks. The southward magnetic field could slightly nudge heart rate variability down, making paced breathing beneficial. Sleep may be impacted; dimming lights earlier can help protect sleep continuity. If you're sensitive to weather changes, keep heat or contrast therapy handy for any pain flare-ups.","playbook":"Incorporate 5–10 minutes of paced breathing exercises or brief heart rate variability biofeedback sessions into your routine. Stay hydrated and consider electrolyte intake while enjoying short daylight exposure and gentle mobility activities. Protect your sleep with blue-light filters and establish a consistent wind-down routine for the evening.","metrics":{"kp_max_24h":3.7,"solar_wind_kms":630.5746423927178,"flares_24h":0,"cmes_24h":0,"schumann_value_hz":7.15,"harmonics":{"f1":7.15,"f2":14.3,"h3":null,"h4":null},"space_json":{"kp_now":null,"bz_now":null,"sw_now":null,"aurora_headline":"G1 possible","aurora_window":"Next 72h"},"earthscope_json":{"title":null,"caption":null,"affects":null,"playbook":null,"metrics":{},"quakes":{"total":8,"total_24h":1,"top":{"mag":5,"place":"South Sandwich Islands region","time_utc":"2025-11-16T00:00:13.694000Z","url":"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us6000rnin","tsunami":0}},"quakes_count":1},"tone":"unsettled","bands":{"kp":"unsettled","sw":"high","bz":"southward"},"sections":{"caption":"Today’s space weather presents a lively yet unsettled tone, with variable influences that may affect your daily rhythm.
