{"day":"2025-12-30","title":"steady cosmic flow","caption":"Today’s space weather presents a steady and quiet atmosphere, with conditions that support a stable cadence in daily activities. The solar wind is flowing at a normal pace, and magnetic field fluctuations are slightly southward, suggesting a supportive environment for focus and recovery. This moderate profile allows for consistent productivity without the distraction of major fluctuations. It's a good day to stay grounded and execute planned tasks.\n\n— Kp 2.0  •  Bz -5.2 nT  •  Schumann 7.32 Hz","snapshot":"The space weather is characterized by a quiet Kp index, normal solar wind speeds, and slightly southward magnetic conditions. There have been no significant solar flares or coronal mass ejections recently, contributing to this stable environment. The Schumann resonance indicates lively activity, which could enhance certain vibrational aspects of daily life.","affects":"With today’s conditions, you might find that your focus and energy levels remain steady, allowing for clear planning and execution of tasks. Recovery practices may feel more effective as the environment supports coherence in physiological responses. Sleep hygiene remains important; keeping evening light low can help maintain a restful night. Many people may notice less reactivity in their heart rate variability during this stable period.","playbook":"To make the most of this day, consider blocking out one to two focus sessions lasting about an hour or so while conditions are steady. Incorporate natural light and movement breaks to keep your circadian rhythm aligned. Remember to hydrate well throughout the day and reserve caffeine for earlier hours to sustain your energy levels.","metrics":{"kp_max_24h":2.0,"solar_wind_kms":392.75592286501376,"flares_24h":0,"cmes_24h":0,"schumann_value_hz":7.32,"harmonics":{"f1":7.32,"f2":14.36,"h3":null,"h4":null},"space_json":{"kp_now":null,"bz_now":null,"sw_now":null,"aurora_headline":"G1 possible","aurora_window":"Next 72h"},"earthscope_json":{"title":null,"caption":null,"affects":null,"playbook":null,"metrics":{},"quakes":{"total":10,"total_24h":4,"top":{"mag":5.1,"place":"80 km SSW of Panguna, Papua New Guinea","time_utc":"2025-12-30T11:22:08.302000Z","url":"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000rli5","tsunami":0}},"quakes_count":4},"tone":"neutral","bands":{"kp":"quiet","sw":"normal","bz":"slightly southward"},"sections":{"caption":"Today’s space weather presents a steady and quiet atmosphere, with conditions that support a stable cadence in daily activities.
