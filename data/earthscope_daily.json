If you feel more sensitive today, quick outdoor walks or using a warm pack can help soothe any nerve flare-ups.","metrics":{"kp_max_24h":3.0,"solar_wind_kms":559.1832884097036,"flares_24h":0,"cmes_24h":1.0,"schumann_value_hz":7.71,"harmonics":{"f1":7.71,"f2":15.12,"h3":null,"h4":null},"space_json":{"kp_now":null,"bz_now":null,"sw_now":null,"aurora_headline":"G1 possible","aurora_window":"Next 72h"},"earthscope_json":{"title":null,"caption":null,"affects":null,"playbook":null,"metrics":{},"quakes":{"total":10,"total_24h":9,"top":{"mag":5.9,"place":"271 km ESE of Attu Station, Alaska","time_utc":"2026-01-15T08:52:46.751000Z","url":"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000rptl","tsunami":1}},"quakes_count":9},"tone":"unsettled","bands":{"kp":"unsettled","sw":"elevated","bz":"southward"},"sections":{"caption":"Today, we experience unsettled space weather conditions with increased solar wind and southward magnetic fields.
