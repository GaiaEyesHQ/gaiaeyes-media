{"day":"2026-02-12","title":"Cosmic Calm Parade","caption":"Today brings a moderate space weather backdrop, characterized by a steady solar wind and a slightly southward magnetic field. It's a day where consistency reigns, making it ideal for sticking to your plans without the chaos of unexpected disturbances. While auroras may be possible soon, don't expect to see them just yet; nature's light show is still warming up. Keep it simple and enjoy the calm before the cosmic storm!\n\n— Kp 2.7  •  Bz -5.5 nT  •  Schumann 7.87 Hz","snapshot":"In this space weather snapshot, conditions are quiet with stable solar wind activity. We’ve seen some fresh solar flare effects and recent coronal mass ejections that could provide some excitement later on. The Schumann resonance is lively, adding an interesting twist to the day’s vibe.","affects":"Under these conditions, you might feel a sense of focus and steadiness—perfect for tackling tasks with a clear mind. Recovery and healing practices are well supported today, which might translate into better sleep for many. Those sensitive to environmental shifts may notice their heart rate variability reflecting this stability, leading to less reactivity overall.","playbook":"To make the most of today: set aside focused work sessions of about an hour while the energy is stable. Incorporate natural light and movement breaks to keep your rhythm in check. Stay hydrated throughout the day, and if you’re a coffee drinker, aim to finish your caffeine intake earlier rather than later.","metrics":{"kp_max_24h":2.7,"solar_wind_kms":398.3424324324324,"flares_24h":1.0,"cmes_24h":1.0,"schumann_value_hz":7.87,"harmonics":{"f1":7.87,"f2":15.33,"h3":null,"h4":null},"space_json":{"kp_now":2.67,"bz_now":null,"sw_now":null,"aurora_headline":"G1 possible","aurora_window":"Next 72h"},"earthscope_json":{"title":null,"caption":null,"affects":null,"playbook":null,"metrics":{},"quakes":{"total":10,"total_24h":6,"top":{"mag":5.1,"place":"275 km E of Levuka, Fiji","time_utc":"2026-02-12T13:52:05.106000Z","url":"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us6000s8h7","tsunami":0}},"quakes_count":6},"tone":"neutral","bands":{"kp":"quiet","sw":"normal","bz":"slightly southward"},"sections":{"caption":"Today brings a moderate space weather backdrop, characterized by a steady solar wind and a slightly southward magnetic field.
