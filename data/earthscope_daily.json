Solar wind is flowing normally, while the magnetic field has taken a southward dip, adding some unpredictability to the mix. Recent activity includes a couple of coronal mass ejections, so there’s some extra flair in the atmosphere.","affects":"You might feel fluctuations in focus and energy today; working in short bursts could be your best bet. Some may notice changes in heart rate variability as the southward magnetic field nudges things around. Sleep might need some extra care tonight, so keep those evenings warm and cozy. Watch for potential tech glitches, especially with satellite services—today’s vibe might make devices a little cranky.","playbook":"Take 5–10 minutes for paced breathing or biofeedback to help manage any ups and downs. Stay hydrated and consider short outdoor breaks to reset your energy. For better sleep, use blue-light filters in the evening and stick to a consistent wind-down routine.","metrics":{"kp_max_24h":2.67,"solar_wind_kms":413.4742363877822,"flares_24h":1.0,"cmes_24h":2.0,"schumann_value_hz":7.55,"harmonics":{"f1":7.55,"f2":14.91,"h3":null,"h4":null},"space_json":{"kp_now":1.33,"bz_now":null,"sw_now":null,"aurora_headline":"G1 possible","aurora_window":"Next 72h"},"earthscope_json":{"title":null,"caption":null,"affects":null,"playbook":null,"metrics":{},"quakes":{"total":8,"total_24h":4,"top":{"mag":5,"place":"149 km WNW of Tobelo, Indonesia","time_utc":"2026-02-09T08:30:52.410000Z","url":"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us6000s7es","tsunami":0}},"quakes_count":4},"tone":"unsettled","bands":{"kp":"quiet","sw":"normal","bz":"southward"},"sections":{"caption":"Today feels a bit like riding a rollercoaster—some ups and downs ahead.
