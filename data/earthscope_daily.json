Recent solar activity has resulted in multiple flares, amplifying the storm's intensity. Schumann resonance is lively, suggesting increased vibrational activity in our environment. All of this points to a dynamic day ahead, especially for those sensitive to these changes.","affects":"You may experience variable focus and energy, so it’s wise to build in extra time for tasks. Those with autonomic sensitivities might notice slight changes in heart rate variability, which paced breathing can help mitigate. Sleep may be disrupted if light exposure isn't managed, so consider dimming lights earlier. Minor communication disruptions could occur at higher latitudes due to the storm.","playbook":"Engage in 5–10 minutes of paced breathing or HRV biofeedback to stabilize your response. Stay hydrated and consider short bursts of daylight exposure combined with gentle movement. Prioritize your sleep by using blue-light filters and establishing a calming wind-down routine. If you feel sensitive, a brief outdoor walk or warm pack can provide relief.","metrics":{"kp_max_24h":5.33,"solar_wind_kms":516.6198639455782,"flares_24h":6.0,"cmes_24h":0,"schumann_value_hz":7.69,"harmonics":{"f1":7.69,"f2":15.41,"h3":null,"h4":null},"space_json":{"kp_now":null,"bz_now":null,"sw_now":null,"aurora_headline":"G1 possible","aurora_window":"Next 72h"},"earthscope_json":{"title":null,"caption":null,"affects":null,"playbook":null,"metrics":{},"quakes":{"total":10,"total_24h":1,"top":{"mag":5.5,"place":"105 km NE of Tatsugō, Japan","time_utc":"2026-02-04T18:20:42.574000Z","url":"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us6000s6gs","tsunami":0}},"quakes_count":1},"tone":"stormy","bands":{"kp":"storm","sw":"elevated","bz":"strong southward"},"sections":{"caption":"Today brings a stormy atmosphere with heightened geomagnetic activity.
