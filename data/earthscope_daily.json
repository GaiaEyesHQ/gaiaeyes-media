{"day":"2026-01-28","title":"Unsettled Cosmic Harmony","caption":"Today's space conditions present a moderately active atmosphere with an unsettled magnetic field. The solar wind is flowing at a normal pace, and the magnetic field is slightly southward, which may encourage some auroral activity in the coming days. It’s a good time to leverage the steady conditions for focused work or recovery practices. Use this clarity wisely to enhance productivity and well-being.\n\n— Kp 3.3  •  Bz -3.6 nT  •  Schumann 7.12 Hz","snapshot":"In today’s space weather, we have an unsettled magnetic field, normal solar wind speeds, and a slightly southward magnetic influence.
