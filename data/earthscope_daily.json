Those sensitive to these fluctuations could find their heart rate variability affected; practicing paced breathing can help manage this. Sleep routines should be carefully guarded against blue light exposure to ensure restful nights. Additionally, some individuals may feel more wired than usual, so take care to relax your shoulders and jaw.","playbook":"Consider incorporating 5–10 minutes of paced breathing exercises to stabilize your energy. Stay hydrated and enjoy brief moments of daylight exposure along with gentle movement. Protect your sleep by using blue-light filters and maintaining a consistent bedtime routine. If feeling particularly sensitive, a quick outdoor walk or using a warm pack can help ease any nerve tension.","metrics":{"kp_max_24h":3.67,"solar_wind_kms":618.85250338295,"flares_24h":0,"cmes_24h":0,"schumann_value_hz":7.68,"harmonics":{"f1":7.68,"f2":15.13,"h3":null,"h4":null},"space_json":{"kp_now":null,"bz_now":null,"sw_now":null,"aurora_headline":"G1 possible","aurora_window":"Next 72h"},"earthscope_json":{"title":null,"caption":null,"affects":null,"playbook":null,"metrics":{},"quakes":{"total":10,"total_24h":3,"top":{"mag":5.3,"place":"126 km SSE of ‘Ohonua, Tonga","time_utc":"2026-01-18T12:31:42.049000Z","url":"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000rqf7","tsunami":0}},"quakes_count":3},"tone":"unsettled","bands":{"kp":"unsettled","sw":"high","bz":"southward"},"sections":{"caption":"Today's space weather presents an unsettled tone with notable variability.
