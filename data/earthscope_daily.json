Some individuals may notice changes in heart rate variability due to the current geomagnetic conditions; try paced breathing techniques to help stabilize. Sleep could be affected, so ensure you have a warm, dimly lit environment for winding down. Minor communication disruptions might occur at higher latitudes, so remain patient with technology.","playbook":"Engage in 5–10 minutes of paced breathing to help center your focus.
