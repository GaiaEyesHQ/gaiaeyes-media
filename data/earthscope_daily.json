{"day":"2026-02-07","title":"Cosmic Rollercoaster Ride","caption":"Today brings a lively dose of cosmic energy with an unsettled tone. Expect some variability in your focus and energy levels, so it's wise to schedule breaks throughout the day and pace yourself during critical tasks. The atmosphere is buzzing, setting the stage for possible auroras in the coming days. Keep your plans flexible and your pace steady as we navigate these energetic shifts.\n\n— Kp 3.7  •  Bz -5.6 nT  •  Schumann 7.69 Hz","snapshot":"Space weather is showing signs of activity with elevated solar winds and a slightly southward magnetic field. While no solar flares or coronal mass ejections have been detected, the Schumann resonance is lively, hinting at heightened atmospheric vibrations. This combination may lead to fluctuations in our daily rhythms, so stay alert!","affects":"You might feel a bit like a rollercoaster today, with ups and downs in your focus and energy. Some may notice their heart rate variability dipping slightly due to the magnetic influences—don't forget to breathe! As evening approaches, prioritize winding down properly to ensure quality sleep tonight. If you're feeling extra sensitive, tech glitches could be more frequent, so keep that in mind during your digital activities.","playbook":"Try 5–10 minutes of paced breathing to help stabilize your system, or consider brief HRV biofeedback sessions. Stay hydrated and grab some electrolytes; gentle movement outdoors can do wonders. Protect your sleep by using blue-light filters on screens and maintaining a calming evening routine. If you're feeling heightened sensitivities, consider a quick grounding walk outside or using a warm pack for any nerve flare-ups.","metrics":{"kp_max_24h":3.7,"solar_wind_kms":516.5970037453184,"flares_24h":0,"cmes_24h":0,"schumann_value_hz":7.69,"harmonics":{"f1":7.69,"f2":15.68,"h3":null,"h4":null},"space_json":{"kp_now":null,"bz_now":null,"sw_now":null,"aurora_headline":"G1 possible","aurora_window":"Next 72h"},"earthscope_json":{"title":null,"caption":null,"affects":null,"playbook":null,"metrics":{},"quakes":{"total":8,"total_24h":1,"top":{"mag":5.9,"place":"Pulau Pulau Tanimbar, Indonesia","time_utc":"2026-02-06T21:20:14.809000Z","url":"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us6000s711","tsunami":0}},"quakes_count":1},"tone":"unsettled","bands":{"kp":"unsettled","sw":"elevated","bz":"slightly southward"},"sections":{"caption":"Today brings a lively dose of cosmic energy with an unsettled tone.
