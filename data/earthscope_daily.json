A slight southward orientation in the magnetic field indicates a mild influence on Earth. There have been no solar flares recently, but one coronal mass ejection has occurred. The Schumann resonance is lively, indicating active electromagnetic activity in our atmosphere.","affects":"In terms of how you might feel today, expect a quieter field which could enhance focus on deep tasks. Recovery practices are generally supported by these conditions, promoting heart rate variability stability. As evening approaches, maintaining a warm and low light environment will aid sleep quality.
