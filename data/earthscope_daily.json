Some individuals may notice changes in heart rate variability due to the current geomagnetic conditions; practicing paced breathing can be beneficial. Sleep could also be affected, so it's crucial to establish a calming nighttime routine. Minor communication disruptions may occur, particularly for those in higher latitude regions.","playbook":"Engage in 5–10 minutes of paced breathing or biofeedback techniques to stabilize your autonomic response. Stay hydrated and consider electrolyte balance, while getting brief exposure to daylight. To protect your sleep, utilize blue-light filters and maintain a consistent winding-down period each evening. If you're feeling sensitive to these fluctuations, try a quick outdoor walk or use a warm pack for any discomfort.","metrics":{"kp_max_24h":4.0,"solar_wind_kms":519.8519699812383,"flares_24h":0,"cmes_24h":0,"schumann_value_hz":7.67,"harmonics":{"f1":7.67,"f2":15.13,"h3":null,"h4":null},"space_json":{"kp_now":null,"bz_now":null,"sw_now":null,"aurora_headline":"G2 possible","aurora_window":"Next 72h"},"earthscope_json":{"title":null,"caption":null,"affects":null,"playbook":null,"metrics":{},"quakes":{"total":10,"total_24h":3,"top":{"mag":5,"place":"southern East Pacific Rise","time_utc":"2026-01-02T07:52:04.790000Z","url":"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us7000rm2l","tsunami":0}},"quakes_count":3},"tone":"unsettled","bands":{"kp":"active","sw":"elevated","bz":"southward"},"sections":{"caption":"Today, we experience active geomagnetic conditions that may create an unsettled atmosphere.
