The solar wind is flowing normally, but recent coronal mass ejections have stirred things up a bit.

The southward orientation of the magnetic field indicates some potential for disturbances. Although no solar flares have occurred recently, there was a notable coronal mass ejection that could influence Earth’s atmosphere.

Some individuals may experience mild autonomic responses, making paced breathing beneficial. As evening approaches, maintaining a warm-lit environment can help support better sleep quality. Those who are sensitive might feel brief tingles or heaviness; planning short breaks can be advantageous.","playbook":"Consider practicing paced breathing for 5–10 minutes to help regulate your response to fluctuations. Stay hydrated and ensure you're getting enough electrolytes while incorporating gentle movement into your routine. To protect your sleep, use blue-light filters and maintain a consistent wind-down ritual before bed. If you’re feeling sensitive, a quick outdoor walk or using a warm pack can help ease discomfort.","metrics":{"kp_max_24h":3.33,"solar_wind_kms":403.211125,"flares_24h":0,"cmes_24h":1.0,"schumann_value_hz":6.83,"harmonics":{"f1":6.83,"f2":13.5,"h3":null,"h4":null},"space_json":{"kp_now":null,"bz_now":null,"sw_now":null,"aurora_headline":"G2 possible","aurora_window":"Next 72h"},"earthscope_json":{"title":null,"caption":null,"affects":null,"playbook":null,"metrics":{},"quakes":{"total":10,"total_24h":6,"top":{"mag":5,"place":"83 km WSW of Panguna, Papua New Guinea","time_utc":"2025-10-28T09:13:47.150000Z","url":"https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us6000rjwa","tsunami":0}},"quakes_count":6},"tone":"unsettled","bands":{"kp":"unsettled","sw":"normal","bz":"southward"},"sections":{"caption":"Today, we're experiencing an unsettled space weather tone with some variability in conditions.
